<h1>Customer Churn Analysis: Trends and Recommendations</h1>
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p>This project was part of the PwC Power BI Job Simulation Certification Journey. I was tasked with creating a Power BI dashboard to perform a comprehensive analysis of customer churn and provide actionable insights to understand the factors driving attrition. Additionally, I proposed recommendations to improve customer retention.</p>
<p>The dataset, sourced from an Excel file, contained over 7,043 records and provided detailed customer information across various dimensions. These included demographic factors such as gender, senior citizen status, partner or dependent status, as well as contract types, subscribed services, payment methods, tenure, and more. This rich dataset allowed me to analyze churn from multiple perspectives and derive meaningful insights.</p>
<p>To begin, I conducted data profiling to ensure data quality and prepared it for analysis. I then developed an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring diverse visuals such as scatter charts, pie charts, cards, multi-row cards, and donut charts. I also created multiple DAX measures to extract key metrics and highlight significant trends.</p>
<p>The dashboard provided a clear, visual representation of how various factors influenced customer attrition. It enabled stakeholders to identify critical areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance retention strategies.</p>
<h3>Tools Used:</h3>
<p>Power BI Desktop</p>
<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<ul> 
  <li><strong>Tenure and Contract Type:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Customers with shorter tenure and those on month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn rates (42% for month-to-month contracts).</li> </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Customers using electronic checks show the highest churn rate (45.29%), indicating potential dissatisfaction or friction with this method.</li> </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li><strong>Service Bundling:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Customers subscribing to only streaming services (movies or TV) have a 60%+ churn rate, while those with multiple services experience reduced churn.</li> </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Customers logging 1–9 tech tickets have a churn rate of 69.38%, indicating technical challenges are a major driver of dissatisfaction.</li> </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul> 
  <li><strong>Encourage Long-Term Commitments:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Offer incentives or discounts to migrate customers from month-to-month contracts to longer-term plans.</li> </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li><strong>Promote Service Bundling:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Introduce attractive bundles that combine entertainment with other services to increase perceived value and reduce churn.</li> </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li><strong>Improve Technical Support:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Prioritize customers with recurring issues by offering proactive assistance or dedicated support teams.</li> </ul> 
  </li> 
  <li><strong>Address Payment Method Challenges:</strong> 
    <ul> <li>Investigate concerns with electronic check payments and encourage a shift to more reliable or convenient methods through incentives.</li> </ul> 
  </li> 
</ul>
<h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
<p>Although I already had experience creating dynamic visualizations, this project provided valuable clarity on a few key aspects of dashboard design.</p>
<p>First, I learned the importance of prioritizing information. Dashboards have limited space, so it’s essential to focus on displaying only the most relevant insights. This project helped me develop the ability to identify which information deserves a spot on the dashboard to effectively communicate key findings.</p>
<p>Second, I gained insights into the art of organizing complex information within a constrained space. Not every detail needs to be presented as an elaborate visual; simplicity and clarity are often more effective. This project gave me a fresh perspective on structuring and arranging visuals to create a dashboard that is both insightful and user-friendly.</p>
